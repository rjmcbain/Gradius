### Gradius

Welcome to my game.

It is a remake of the 1985 NES classic Gradius.

In this game the player will be able to choose between 1 and 2 players. In both modes the players need to stay alive by dodging the boss for 30 seconds. If players succeed, they will be taken to a game over page. 

At the end of the battle the player will be presented with a new mode, HARD MODE.

### Hidden Features

On both 1 player and 2 players game modes there is a hidden button to take the players back to the main screen. Click anywhere on the screen to go back to the home page.

On the game over page there is a hidden link that takes them back to their game. This way the players dont have to go throught the home page to play. Click on the background image above game over and you will be back in the action!
