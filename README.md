### Gradius

Welcome to my game.

It is a remake of the 1985 NES classic Gradius.

In this game the player will be able to choose between 1 and 2 players. In both modes the players need to dodge obstacles and get past the main boss and get to the finish line. Players have 1 minute to race to the other side. 

At the end of the battle the player will be presented with a new mode, HARD MODE.
